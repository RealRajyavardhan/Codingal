        Cricket's origins date back to the 16th century in England. The game evolved over centuries, with the earliest
        definite
        reference to cricket being played in the 1600s. By the 18th century, cricket had become a major sport in
        England. The
        Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), founded in 1787, became the sport's custodian, codifying the game's laws.

        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
        Unqualified, the
        word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports
        commonly
        called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United
        States, and
        sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football
        (specifically
        American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football;
        and rugby
        union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as
        "football
        codes". There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many
        different
        parts of the world.
