                <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                <p>
                    <font size="5">Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred
                        from wolves. They
                        have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.
                </p>

                    The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf.
                    Also called the
                    domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
                    hunter-gatherers. The
                    dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the
                    development of agriculture.
                    Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich
                    diet that would be
                    inadequate for other canids.

                <h2>Facts About Cats</h2>
                <p>
                    <font size="5"> Cats are good animals. Cats are small, carnivorous mammals that are often kept as
                        pets. They are
                        known for their agility, independence, and playful behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated
                    carnivorous mammal. It
                    is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have
                    shown that the
                    domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and
                    working cat, but it
                    also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship
                    and its ability to
                    kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats.
                    It has a strong,
                    flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well
                    developed. It is a
                    social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.

                <h2>Facts About Camels</h2>
                <p>
                    <font size="5">Camels are large, domesticated mammals that are known for their distinctive humps on
                        their backs.
                        They are well adapted to life in arid desert environments and are often used as pack animals for
                        transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A camel (from Latin: camelus and Ancient Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from Ancient Semitic: gāmāl) is an
                    even-toed
                    ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.
                    Camels have long been
                    domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (camel milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt
                    from camel hair).
                    Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of
                    transport for passengers
                    and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the
                    world's camel
                    population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The wild Bactrian camel is a distinct
                    species that is not
                    ancestral to the domestic Bactrian camel, and is now critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000
                    individuals.
